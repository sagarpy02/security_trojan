# security_trojan
In this project we add trojan code which will help the user to find out who is trying to log into your system.

The system we are using nowdays that is sending mail or massage if someone loged in into your account but I think this is many of password of our social media account can be crack just by guessing so in here is the solution of that if someone is guessing or trying to login to your account it will take a picture of that person and send it to you .
